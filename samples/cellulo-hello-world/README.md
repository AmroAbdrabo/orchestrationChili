cellulo-hello-world
===================

This is the most basic Cellulo application to get you started. Can be built with Qt 5.6.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 for Ubuntu 16.04 or Android SDK 9 and NDK r10e. It needs [qml-cellulo](../../) to be installed. It is intended to be loaded into Qt Creator, built and deployed from there.
