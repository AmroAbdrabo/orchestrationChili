1. Create new .h/.cpp files and put CelluloZone as the parent of this new type
2. Implement calculate,write, read and getRatioProperties functions in the zones representing the zone focus
3. Add the new type in CelluloZoneType enum
4. Handles this new type in CelluloZoneEngine, CelluloZoneJsonHandler and CelluloBluetooth types switches
5. Register this new type and subtypes in CelluloBluetoothPlugin

-> As an example check how CelluloPointDistance is implemented
